# Driver Drowsiness Detection with YOLOv8 and Roboflow

This project aims to implement a driver drowsiness detection system using YOLOv8 for object detection and the Roboflow tool for efficient annotation of training data.

## Overview

Driver drowsiness detection is crucial for enhancing road safety. This project leverages YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection framework, to identify signs of drowsiness in drivers.
Driver drowsiness detection is a critical aspect of modern vehicle safety systems designed to monitor and alert drivers when signs of drowsiness or inattention are detected. 
The training data is annotated using the Roboflow tool to streamline the annotation process.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Roboflow account for annotation
